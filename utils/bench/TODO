* ciphertext size
* throughput (plaintext/seconds)
* proof generate (seconds)
* proof verify (seconds)
* Compare with XOR over N

== Macrobenchmarks == (over N, over % nodes sending)
* (chat-room) tweet-sized messages
* 1MB PDF, infrequent

== Scheduling ==
* change length of slots
* dynamic slot opening and closing
(using DC-net XOR with single bit)

== Accountability ==
